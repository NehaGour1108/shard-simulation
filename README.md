To simulate the creation of multiple H2 databases (representing multiple shards like `insta1`, `insta2`, etc.), we will create a schema across all of them with `posts`, `users`, and `profile` tables. Additionally, we will demonstrate how to alter a schema and then show how data migration can be tedious and slow (using both SQL dump utilities and manual iteration for rows).

### Steps Breakdown

1. **Create Multiple Databases (`insta1`, `insta2`, etc.)**
   - We'll create three H2 databases: `insta1`, `insta2`, and `insta3`, with the same schema (tables `posts`, `users`, `profile`).
   
2. **Alter Table Schema**:
   - We will alter one of the tables in one of the databases to observe the complexity of altering schemas across all shards.

3. **Create a New Database Server** (another port).
   - We'll configure H2 to run on a custom port and connect to that server.

4. **Dump Data from One Shard and Load It Into Another**:
   - We'll demonstrate using the H2 `sqldump` utility to dump data from one shard and load it into another.
   
5. **Stretch: Manually Migrating Data Iteratively**:
   - We will iterate over rows and manually insert data from one shard to another, which would show how complex and slow this approach can be.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that H2 Database is available.
- You can use the `H2` web console (`http://localhost:8082`) to interact with the databases.
- Maven and Java for the code.


### Code Explanation:

1. **Setting up Shards**:
   - We create three in-memory databases (`insta1`, `insta2`, `insta3`), each with three tables: `users`, `posts`, and `profile`.
   
2. **Alter Table**:
   - In the `alterTableSchema` method, we add a new column (`PostDate`) to the `posts` table in `insta1` to demonstrate schema changes.
   
3. **Data Insertion**:
   - We insert user data into `users`, `posts`, and `profile` tables, distributing the users between `insta1` and `insta2` based on whether their ID is even or odd.

4. **Dump and Load Data**:
   - Using H2's `SCRIPT TO` and `RUNSCRIPT FROM` commands, we dump the data from `insta1` and load it into `insta2`. This demonstrates how tedious it could be to move large amounts of data between shards.
   
5. **SQL Command Execution**:
   - The `executeSQLCommand` method is used to run the SQL dump and load commands.

### Stretch: Iterating Over Rows to Transfer Data Manually

To

 demonstrate how slow and complex manually migrating data can be, we could fetch rows from one shard and insert them one by one into another. This is not shown in full here, but the following concept can be added in the `insertDataIntoShards` method to iterate over the result set and manually insert records one by one. This is far more inefficient than using bulk operations like `SCRIPT TO`.

---

### Conclusion:
In this example:
- **Schema Management**: Altering tables manually across many shards can be complex and error-prone.
- **Data Migration**: Using utilities like `SCRIPT TO` is much more efficient than iterating over rows for large data transfers. However, iterating manually highlights how tedious and slow it could be, especially if done at a massive scale.
